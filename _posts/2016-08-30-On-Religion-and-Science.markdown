Throughout my education, I’ve been trained and made biased towards the idea that science works with facts, and that religion works with beliefs. What is said by science, I was told, holds more ground towards being classed as reality than what is said by religion does. Religious talk and preachings are based on the belief held by pious individuals, and scientific fact is knowledge that has been tested, reviewed and confirmed by the smartest of the human race; they seemed so different, and mutually exclusive. I consider myself a scientist, and I believed this, but having worked with science for as long as I have (not very long relatively speaking) has however given me doubts about this.

Since these doubts sprang on me, I started having many heated arguments with my friends about their validity. They are devout scientists (interesting choice of words don’t you think?), and they told me that science is nothing like religion. Science provides facts that have been proven using repeatable experiments; religion gives us statements that are not repeatable and untestable, thus making them beliefs. I argued that science too is fundamentally the same, and is a system of belief. I said that the reason that science seems so different is because it deals with problems that are, quite arrogantly I might add, within out limits of understanding and fathoming. I will try to recreate my arguments here.

Before I begin, I would like to point out that I am referring to the concept of what a religion is. A religion provides us a something to believe in that provides us source that permeates hope and a sense of morality, among other things. The key take-away from that sentence is that religion is a belief; we do not know whether is it true or not, but we believe that it is, without evidence. As such, I am not referring to the religious organisations that have cropped up through history, and how they operate.

Now lets look at what science is. To my understanding, science is a branch of knowledge that encourages validation and verification through the use of the scientiﬁc method; a problem or phenomena is solved or explained by using experimental techniques to verify and validate a hypothesis that is based on previous experience and creative thinking on the said problem or phenomena. The key word here is that the work is tested, and is proven to be true, or fact; it is anything but beliefs, right?

For someone who is familiar with the history of science, and how scientific developments came by, it would be quite obvious that science is nothing contest of who can contradict the other best. Take for example the development of Einstein’s concepts about spacetime. Back in the 1600s, poised with the problem of relative acceleration, Newton proposed that there exists an entity such as absolute space that provides a benchmark to which all acceleration can be measured against. This absolute view of the world challenged the established relativist view of individuals such as Newton’s rival Leibniz, who said that space exists only because it is required, and is not a true entity in and of its self. Newton’s idea of course could not be tested directly because this entity could not be sensed in anyway, but he said that the existence of its effects, which are the effects of acceleration, implies its existence and therefore cannot be refuted. Popular consensus then shifted towards this idea, until Ernst Mach refuted that idea by finding a supposed ﬂaw in Newton’s argument. Once this took hold, Einstein came along and introduced absolute spacetime as a benchmark to which motion is measured against, in his theories of relativity bringing back Newton’s idea (of sorts). It goes back and forth.

Lets also look at a more subtle example. We all are familiar with the idea, or the manifestation of gravity. We experience it everyday; as Newton felt the apple fall on his head, we too observe the pull of gravity as we like our lives. Up until Einstein, we believed what science and experience had told us; we feel the effects of gravity when we are free falling, things always fall down. In the early mid 1900s, Einstein, with his theory of general relativity, said that it was more right to believe that the earth was falling up, than to think that the object falls down. He, through his equivalence principle found an equivalence between acceleration and gravity and shifted our perspective of thinking.

These examples provide some interesting facts about science. We can see that it is open to criticism. Even through its veil of supposed experiments and proven truths, it is open to (and often welcomes) criticism and contradiction. Almost every generation of scientific accomplishment is overturned by the next great idea, rewriting all but very little that had been accepted as truth. Thus, by being contradictable, science does not deal with truths or facts, but rather beliefs; if the truth can be proven to be otherwise, then it is not the truth, but a belief that was thought to be true. This implies, as does the story of general relativity, that the scientific method provides pseudo-facts that are borne through observations biases; we wanted to believe that things fall, and based our experiments around that assumption.

This means that fundamentally, science, like religion, is fundamentally a belief, a belief that my idea is correct, and that the experiments I used prove that. Two things can be said about science then. Firstly, it is that when a scientist dubs something as being fact, as being a law of nature, or as knowledge, there is an underlying assumption that these statements are based on how the scientist perceives the universe. It is understandable that, like the axioms of mathematics, this assumption is not referenced to at every scientific work that is built upon it; it is important however to not forget it.

This leads on to the next 'thing'; science is essentially a religion based on our interpretation of our existence. Time does not flow for a photon travelling at the speed of light. To it, nothing exists; its science will amount to nothing. Likewise, our science is how its followers sees things. How then, can we say that one man's belief on the existence of a god is more wrong than another's belief that the universe originated from an infinitesimal point; they are both results of each man's interpretation of his existence.

I suppose it could be said that, by not being able to fully rid observational biasses that are a result of our need to observe means that we will not be able to uncover the truth, and that the definition of truth should be shifted to being those that are good enough for our existence. Maybe. My point however is that we should try to be more open minded about what religion has to tell us, and not reject its statements as most fanatical scientists do. If you think about it, religion also creates hypotheses that are based on observation and experience. The only difference is that we, like Newton with his absolute space, cannot fathom the methods to measure, test and reproduce its existence and effects; this doesn’t mean it couldn’t be true.
