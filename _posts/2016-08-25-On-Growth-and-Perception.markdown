I started reading Arthur C. Clarke’s book, ‘2010: Odyssey Two’ once again today; it’s probably the tenth time I’ve done so. It was a favourite of mine while I was growing up, mostly because it involved a bunch of smart engineers and scientists who solved problems arising through space travel as they hurtled through the solar system to investigate an alien object and a malfunction, or as its creator believes, a ‘programming anomaly’ of an artificially intelligent computer. I clearly remember what my thoughts were when I was first reading book about 6 years ago, and which bits of the book I was looking forward to reading more about; I found the introductory chapters pretty lackadaisical, and I was more interested in getting to the space stuff.

As I read those first few chapters today, I realised how interesting I found them. In them, the author expresses the feelings of the main character’s unwillingness to leave his family behind for a journey that could take up to and beyond a decade; his 2-year old son will grow up without knowing his father, and his father without knowing him. He talks about how this character’s wife reacts to this news. 6 years ago, I dismissed these feelings as being utterly unrelatable and complete nonsense; if I got the chance to travel through space to see the gas planets, and their worldly different moon, I would agree to it without a moment’s hesitation. Even more, at that time, I was looking forward to finishing school and leaving my family and home country behind to go to start a new adventure at university; I couldn’t wait for that.

But now, after a period of time less than that of the journey my friend in the book is about to embark on, I can say that, I get him. I understand the feeling of not being able to see my loved ones for an extended period of time; I can barely survive a summer without seeing my girlfriend. I understand how leaving behind the place that I truly feel as and want to call my home can be difficult or near impossible. In fact, as I was reading those pages, I realised that if I was given a similar opportunity, I would not only take time to consider, but would also most likely decline.

I suppose this is what growth is. As a 20-year old, I think this is one of the few times that I felt like I really understood what the growth of my mental state is. Growth used to seem just growing taller, growing hair in more places, and being able to get permission to do more varied things. Now, it feels like growth is an adjustment of my point of view, a change that comes across as I accumulate more experiences, or more fundamentally, thoughts. Through this, it was interesting to note how my perception of a past experience was different as I experienced it once more. In fact it seems that as I grow, the feelings that I focus on are changing; I am able to feel more things, but I am also focused on different feelings.

I am intrigued; how will I perceive other past experiences if I am to encounter them later? How will I perceive new experiences? They will obviously feel different if I will encounter them at a different period of my life, so will I experience them at the right time? How will these experiences then change me, or rather allow me to ‘grow’?

I want to know, and I can’t wait to find out.
